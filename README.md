# Testing Gioâ€™s gamma correction

This small gio program crates a window showing two gray ramps.

The top ramp creates the gray by using anti-aliasing.
A 50% covered pixel should be perfectly mid-gray.

The bottom ramp is simply drawing rectangles filled with a
gray different values of gray. 


Both ramps should be identical.
